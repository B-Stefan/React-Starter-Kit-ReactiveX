#Custom typings 
The tsd repository (DefinitelyTyped) ist not always up to date. 
This repository use the latest version of several libraries and not for all I found a proper typescript definition. 

##History 
Is a helper lib for the react-router 

##React-Router
If the react-router release the version 1.0 DefinitelyTyped will update the definition but for now there is no definition for react-router.
